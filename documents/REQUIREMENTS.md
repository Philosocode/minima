# Minima - Requirements
## General Planning
### Problem
YouTube is awesome for learning and productivity, but it's way too distracting. Sites like invidio.us are great, but still distracting and load times can really suck at times.

### Purpose
A minimalist YouTube frontend client to replace invidio.us. Add only the essential features needed for my study workflow and personal use.
